        <h1>LivingSpace</h1>
        <p>LivingSpace is a part of space where physical things are hosted. But everything physical has to have its source in non-physical and everything non-physical has to be hosted in a part of space which is capable of hosting non-physical things. It is the counter part of LivingSpace and will be introduced later in time (t).
        Stay tuned to see how things unfold and how things manifest to serve the purpose existence. I wish you all the best in the journey.
